I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Texas State University. I graduated from the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (2016-2020). My keen interest lies in Machine Learning models and Probabilistic Programming.

During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills through various projects and internships. My final year project, which focused on utilizing software development methodologies and natural language processing techniques to solve problems within the freelance job market, was particularly rewarding. Under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RgWKBwUAAAAJ">(Dr. Jawwad Ahmed Shamsi)</a>, I developed a named entity recognizer approach that aimed to address the challenges faced by job applicants in the freelance industry.
